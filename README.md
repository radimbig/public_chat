2. Run the command 'npm install' to install the required React modules.
### `npm start`
3. Run the command 'npm start' to start the frontend server.
### `npm start`
4. Open another terminal window and navigate to the root folder of the project.
5. Run the command 'dotnet run' to start the backend server.
### `npm start`
6. Open your browser and go to 'http://localhost:[port]/' to see the chat application in action.
